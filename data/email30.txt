Hey {{lead.First Name}}, 
You’ve worked so hard to capture your leads, but if you’re like most businesses, you stop following up after about 2-3 attempts. 

This week we have two webinar sessions to make it easy to add 7 touches to your outreach and also make sure that they never miss a new blog post.

Here’s what you can learn during this week’s Automation Hours:

Use Short Term Nurture Campaigns to Successfully Convert More Prospects to Customers—with Renée Boudakian
It typically takes somewhere between 7-12 touches to convert a stranger to a customer, although most businesses give up after only 1 or 2 outreach attempts. To make sure you never let another lead slip through the cracks without nurturing them, we'll show you how to automate those touches with a swipe and deploy email copy to maximize your chance of success. This is more than just a drip campaign, it's automation!
