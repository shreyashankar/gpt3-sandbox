Hi {{lead.First Name}}, 
When I was a small business owner I remember how frustrating appointment setting would be. I would leave leads voicemails offering a time to meet. Later, they would call back and leave a voicemail asking for a different time. I’d call back and say (again via voicemail) that the time wouldn’t work and suggest yet another option.

Most leads never hear that last email, they’re already moved on and hired someone else. Slow follow-up and irritating appointment setting are a recipe for lost sales. 

Join me to learn how you can take the pain out of appointments and convert more leads in this week’s Automation Hours:
